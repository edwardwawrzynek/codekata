# Chess Server Protocol

Communication takes place over a websocket connection. The client and server send commands between each other. Commands take the form of:
```
cmd arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3
```

For example, a session between the server and a client that creates, joins, and begins playing a chess game:
```
[client] version 2
[server] okay
[client] apikey f265a80e95fb4734b1557f8d1ff07556
[server] okay
[client] new_game chess
[server] new_game 123
[client] join_game 123
[server] okay
[client] start_game 123
[server] okay
[server] go 123, chess, 341269, 2000, rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
[client] play 123, e2e4
[server] okay
[server] go 123, chess, 305434, 2000, rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 2
[client] play 123, g1f3
[server] okay
...
```

## Versioning
There are two versions of the protocol: `1` (backwards compatible with codekata-chess), and `2`. Version `2` should be preferred, as it offers the ability to play multiple games at once and handle games of different types.

New connections start in version `1` by default, so clients must upgrade the connection by sending the command:
```
version 2
```
